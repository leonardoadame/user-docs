# Billable resources for Snyk Cloud

## How does Snyk count resources?

Snyk Cloud identifies security issues in your cloud environment’s resource configurations, relationships and network connections to ensure your applications and infrastructure are secure. While we detect and secure hundreds of types of resources in public cloud environments — including but not limited to servers, storage, network settings, IAM — billable resources are only a subset of Compute and Storage resource types. Snyk counts each of the following as a billable resource:
