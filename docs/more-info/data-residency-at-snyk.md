# Regional hosting and data residency

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**\
This feature is available with Enterprise plans. See [pricing plans](https://snyk.io/plans/) for more details.
{% endhint %}

Snyk can host your data in a number of regions. During initial onboarding of your system, you can work with your account team to select a multi-tenant region. For single-tenant availability (Snyk Private Cloud), reach out to your account team in advance of onboarding.

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, customers are hosted in the US region.
{% endhint %}

## **What is data residency?**

Data residency allows you to control what region Snyk hosts a selected subset of your data in. For more information, see [Regional and global data](data-residency-at-snyk.md#regional-and-global-data).

Data residency is available for [Snyk Open Source](../scan-application-code/snyk-open-source/), [Snyk Code](../scan-application-code/snyk-code/), [Snyk Container](../scan-containers/), and [Snyk Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](../scan-cloud-configurations/snyk-infrastructure-as-code/).

## **How does data residency work?**

During your system onboarding, you can work with your account team to select a hosting region.

{% hint style="warning" %}
After you select a region, the data in that region cannot be migrated to another region. Moving to a new region requires a complete re-onboarding.
{% endhint %}

## **What regions are available?**

Snyk offers data residency for the following regions:

|          Region         |           URL          |
| :---------------------: | :--------------------: |
|      USA (default)      |   https://app.snyk.io  |
| EU (Germany, Frankfurt) | https://app.eu.snyk.io |
|     AUS (Australia)     | https://app.au.snyk.io |

Single-tenant deployments may support more regions than the ones listed here, subject to validation of architectural service supportability by Snyk engineering.&#x20;

## Regional and global data

Snyk leverages a number of sub-processors to provide you with a high-quality service. Thus not all data types can be stored within your region of choice. The list of sub-processors is available [on the Snyk website](https://snyk.io/policies/sub-processors/).

See [How Snyk handles your data](how-snyk-handles-your-data.md) for product-specific examples of how this data is handled.

## Regional multi and single-tenant hosting notes

Snyk offers almost all the same features, support, and performance in the regional multi and single-tenant regions as in the US region.

Snyk Cloud is not yet available. For an up-to-date overview of feature parity across regions, reach out to your account team.

### EU and AU datacenter account creation

EU and AU datacenter Snyk accounts are available only with the purchase of an [Enterprise plan](https://snyk.io/plans/). The resources and URLs are as follows.

### Login and Web UI URLs

#### **EU**

[https://app.eu.snyk.io/](https://app.eu.snyk.io/)

#### **AU**

[https://app.au.snyk.io/](https://app.au.snyk.io/)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Using Snyk.io or app.snyk.io will not redirect you to these URLs.
{% endhint %}

### API URLs

Follow the docs as usual, but base URLs are:

#### **EU**

API v1: https://api.eu.snyk.io/v1/\
REST API: https://api.eu.snyk.io/rest/

#### **AU**

API v1: https://api.au.snyk.io/v1/\
REST API: https://api.au.snyk.io/rest/

### CLI and CI pipelines URLs

Both CLI and CI running CLI need to be configured to run against your instance. To do this, run the following:

#### **EU**

`snyk config set endpoint=https://app.eu.snyk.io/api`

#### **AU**

`snyk config set endpoint=https://app.au.snyk.io/api`

Alternatively, have an environment variable on your machine or CI tool:

#### **EU**

`SNYK_API=https://app.eu.snyk.io/api`

#### **AU**

`SNYK_API=https://app.au.snyk.io/api`

When running Jenkins, use the additional argument:

#### **EU**

`--API=https://app.eu.snyk.io/api`

#### **AU**

`--API=https://app.au.snyk.io/api`

### IDEs URLs

Snyk IDE extensions have similar modifiable options to the CLI and need to be configured to use the appropriate endpoint. In the extensions settings for Snyk in your IDE, set the **Custom Endpoint** parameter to the appropriate value:

#### **EU**

`https://app.eu.snyk.io/api`

#### **AU**

`https://app.au.snyk.io/api`

For Snyk Code, ensure the latest version of IDE plugins are in use. The following specifies the minimum version required:

VSCode - 1.2.18\
Visual Studio - 1.1.21\
IntelliJ - 2.4.32

### Broker URLs

Follow [github.com/snyk/broker](https://github.com/snyk/broker) docs as usual BUT add an extra environment variable in the container:

#### **AU**

`-e BROKER_SERVER_URL=https://broker.au.snyk.io`

For Broker deployed by Helm chart, follow [https://github.com/snyk/snyk-broker-helm](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-broker-helm) docs, and add the following variable:

#### **EU**

`--set brokerServerUrl=https://broker.eu.snyk.io`

#### **AU**

`--set brokerServerUrl=https://broker.au.snyk.io`

### Broker with Code Agent URLs

Follow the [Snyk Broker - Code Agent](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/snyk-broker/snyk-broker-code-agent) instructions BUT add an extra environment variable in the Code Agent container:

#### **EU**

`-e UPSTREAM_URL=https://deeproxy.eu.snyk.io`

#### **AU**

`-e UPSTREAM_URL=https://deeproxy.au.snyk.io`

For Broker with Code Agent deployed by Helm chart, follow the [https://github.com/snyk/snyk-broker-helm](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-broker-helm) instructions, and add the following variable in the Code Agent chart:
