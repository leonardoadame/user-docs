# Using Snyk IaC with the Web UI

You can use Snyk IaC with the [Snyk Web UI](../../getting-started/quickstart/create-a-snyk-account/logging-in-to-an-existing-account.md) to find and fix issues in configuration files.

1. In your **Projects** listing, select the Project to open.
2. Examine the information and issue cards for that Project:

The information available shows [Snyk Project ](../../manage-issues/introduction-to-snyk-projects/)information including:

* Snapshot information showing when the Project was last tested
* **Overview**, **History,** and **Settings** information.\
  You can use the **History** section to view previous snapshots of Project.
* Filters on the left of the screen

## Issue card details

Each issue card shows specific details about that issue:
