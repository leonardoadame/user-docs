# Test your Integrated IaC files with Snyk CLI

{% hint style="info" %}
To use the latest Integrated IaC, install Snyk CLI v1.1022.0 or later.
{% endhint %}

You can test your IaC files with [Integrated IaC](./) by using the Snyk CLI. There are some differences between Integrated IaC and the current IaC, which are summarized in the following table.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th></th><th width="383.3333333333333"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Current IaC support</strong></td><td><strong>Integrated IaC support</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Terraform (single file)</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Terraform (modules)</strong></td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Terraform (plan)</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CloudFormation</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>AWS CDK</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Azure Resource Manager</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Kubernetes</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>Coming soon</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="warning" %}
Although Integrated IaC provides better support for Terraform than the current IaC, line number information is not provided in scan results for the current IaC.
{% endhint %}

## Stage 1: Test IaC files

Snyk Infrastructure as Code allows you to test your configuration files with the CLI. For information on how to use the `snyk iac test` command, see the [`snyk iac test` command help](../../snyk-cli/commands/iac-test.md).

An example of the output follows.

```

Test Summary

  Organization: demo-org

✔ Files without issues: 0
✗ Files with issues: 1
  Invalid files: 0
  Ignored issues: 0
  Total issues: 1 [ 0 critical, 0 high, 0 medium, 1 low ]
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The CLI for Integrated IaC can also scan Terraform modules, regardless of whether they are public or private. Run `terraform init` before running the `snyk iac test` command, and the CLI will read the generated `.terraform files.`
{% endhint %}

## Stage 2: View IaC issues in the Snyk Web UI

You can use the [`snyk iac test`](../../snyk-cli/commands/iac-test.md) CLI command to address known configuration issues.

To see these issues displayed in the Snyk Web UI, run the following CLI command:

`snyk iac test myproject --report`

An example of the output follows.

```
> snyk iac test myproject --report

Follow the link in the CLI output to see your issues in the Snyk Web UI. To learn more about the cloud issues view, see [View Cloud and Integrated IaC issues in the Snyk Web UI](cloud-and-integrated-iac-issues/view-cloud-and-integragted-iac-issues-in-the-snyk-web-ui.md).

## Stage 3: Fix IaC Issues

Act on the recommendations generated by Snyk IaC.

1. After you have run a test, you can see all the relevant details about where that issue exists, as well as advice on how to remediate that issue.
2. Fix the issue based on the remediation advice.
3. Run another test to see if the issue has been resolved.
4. Optional: View a list of all Integrated IaC and cloud context rules and adjust rule severity as needed. For more information, see [Managing Cloud and Integrated IaC rules](managing-cloud-and-integrated-iac-rules.md).

## Get help

To get help, run `snyk iac test --help` or see the [`snyk iac test`](../../snyk-cli/commands/iac-test.md) help in the documentation.

## Get started with Terraform Cloud

To use Integrated IaC with Terraform Cloud, see [Terraform Cloud for IaC](../../integrations/ci-cd-integrations/integrating-snyk-with-terraform-cloud/).
