# Insights setup: User Permissions

Insights is currently available at the Group level, so [please grant relevant users the Group viewer role](../../../snyk-admin/manage-users-and-permissions/member-roles.md#edit-a-role). This is the minimum required permission, but Group Admins are also able to view Insights.

After a user has the right permission, they will see a new **Insights** option on the left-hand navigation at the Group level.
