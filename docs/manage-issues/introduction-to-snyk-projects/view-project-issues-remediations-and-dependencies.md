# View Project issues, fixes, and dependencies

## Introduction

The following Project information is available on the Snyk Web UI:

* [Issues](view-project-issues-remediations-and-dependencies.md#view-issues): the number of vulnerabilities and license issues
* [Fixes](view-project-issues-remediations-and-dependencies.md#view-fixes): fix advice
* [Dependencies](view-project-issues-remediations-and-dependencies.md#view-dependencies): the total number of direct and transitive (nested) dependencies

### View issues

The Project details page displays Issue cards on the **Issues** tab. The information provided includes vulnerabilities and license issues (for Open Source Projects).

Use the filters in the panel to the left to narrow the search for issues. Select the checkboxes to filter issues by **Issue type**, **Severity**, **Exploit Maturity**, **Fixability**, and **Status**. You can also edit the **Priority Score** slider to change the range displayed; the default is 0 to 1000.

Issue details are shown on Issue cards in the main area, sorted by priority score. See [Issue card information](issue-card-information.md) for more details.

### View dependencies

Snyk uses the package manager for your application to build the dependency tree and display it in the **Dependencies** tab of the Project issues detail page. This tab shows which components introduce a vulnerability, which indicates how the dependency was introduced to the application.

For example.
